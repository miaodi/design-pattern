# Abstract Factory
---
The __abstract factory pattern__ provides a way to encapsulate a group of individual factories that have a __common theme__ without specifying their concrete classes. In normal usage, the client solftware creates a concrete implementation of the abstract factory and then uses the generic interface of the factory to create the concrete objects that are part of the theme.
