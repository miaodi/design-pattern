# Adapter

The __adapter pattern__ is known as Wrapper, that allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface. 

## Applicability
*   You want to use an existing class, and its interface does not match the one you need.
*   You want to create a reusable class that cooperates with unrelated or unforeseen classes.
*   You need to use several existing subclasses, but it's impractical to adapt their interface by subclassing every one. An object adapter can adapt the interface of their parent class.
